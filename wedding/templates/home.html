        <h2>Alex</h2>
        <p>Alex grew up in Ridgefield, Washington - you'll get to see exactly where if you come to the wedding. He is a computer programmer who makes his living building things for the internet. He loves computer games, brewing beer, and going on adventures. He loves Colette because she makes him "get off his [behind] and do things."</p>

    <div class="span4">
        <h2>Colette</h2>
        <p>Colette grew up in Ester, Alaska and moved to Portland on a whim - best decision ever. She accidentally ended up in advertising, where she makes a living bossing people around and organizing things. She loves planning adventures, exploring, cooking, and being a dork. She thinks Alex is the bees knees because he has a huge smile, is extremely good natured, and seems to enjoy going on all the whacky adventures she plans. Plus he let her get a puppy.</p>
